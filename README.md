This is simplest example which was created by using SAP Build Code and gen-AI extension named as `Joule`.

By Jouly's help it was created model and sample data.

You can read documentation how it was done using this SAP blog:

[SAP Build - create Full-Stack application CAP+FIORI by using Joule.](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-members/sap-build-create-full-stack-application-cap-fiori-by-using-joule/ba-p/13664900)
